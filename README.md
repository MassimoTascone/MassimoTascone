ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Massimo, a passionate frontend developer with almos 3 years of experience in web development. 
My journey started as a frontend Dev @Decathlon Belgium with SvelteJs, where I honed my skills in creating efficient and interactive user interfaces. 

Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge by diving into the exciting world of React, Next.js, and TypeScript. I believe in continuously pushing myself to learn and grow, and these technologies have become my latest fascination.
