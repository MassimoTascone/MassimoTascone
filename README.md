ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Massimo, a passionate frontend developer with almos 3 years of experience in web development. 
My journey started as a frontend Dev @Decathlon Belgium with SvelteJs, where I honed my skills in creating efficient and interactive user interfaces. 

Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge by diving into the exciting world of React, Next.js, and TypeScript. I believe in continuously pushing myself to learn and grow, and these technologies have become my latest fascination.

One thing that sets me apart is my love for collaboration and working in teams. I thrive in an environment where ideas are shared, and we collectively create remarkable solutions. I bring a positive attitude, effective communication skills, and a strong work ethic to every project I'm involved in.
